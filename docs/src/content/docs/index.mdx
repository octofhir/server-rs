Welcome to the OctoFHIR Server (Rust) documentation.

Motivation:

- Build a practical, minimal FHIR server for development and integration testing.
- Grow a small ecosystem of Rust libraries (core/search/db/api) usable independently.
- Keep things async-first, Rust-first, and easy to extend.

What you get in the MVP:

- In-memory storage with CRUD and basic search for key resources (e.g., Patient, Observation).
- JSON-only (`application/fhir+json` and `application/json`), CapabilityStatement at `/metadata`.
- Config via `octofhir.toml` and env overrides; observability hooks; hot reload.
